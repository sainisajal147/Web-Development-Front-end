<h1 id="title"> The Medicine delivery System</h1>
<p id="p2"> Hubs are healthcare hotspots that serve as the resource centers (usually places with major health centres & hospitals, big cities etc). Drones, carrying the medical goods, fly out to ‘Stations’ (much like post offices or domestic airports), where they drop their package and either fly on to make the next delivery or back to the hub. In addition to being the resource centres, these are also recharging points for the drones and each hub has 6 drones associated with it and connects to at least 5
stations</p>
<p id="p1">since i want you more than wnat ,no i need you more than need, i could die now more than die, when you there in front of me, oh well i have seen you in jeans with no makeup on and i stood there in aww as you're a date for the prom and i'm blessed as a man to have seen ou in white but I've never seen anything quite like you tonight no no i never seen anything quite like you tonights </p>
<p> To make a particular delivery, an appropriate drone is to be chosen, one that would minimise the fuel intake and overall cost. This can be picked from one of the following scenarios:</p>
<ul>
<li>using a Drone that is stationary at the hub</li>
<li>using a Drone that is flying out to make a delivery (not crossed halfway on its destination), that can be called back to pick up the additional package.</li>
